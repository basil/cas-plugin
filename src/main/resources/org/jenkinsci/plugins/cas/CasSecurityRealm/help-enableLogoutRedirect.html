    When checked, Jenkins will redirect to CAS after logging out the local user, in order
    to destroy the SSO session. Other CAS-enabled applications implementing 
    <a href="https://apereo.github.io/cas/6.2.x/installation/Logout-Single-Signout.html" target="_blank">Single Logout (SLO)</a>
    may also opt to destroy their sessions.
    
    <p>
    If CAS is configured to follow logout redirects, it will automatically come back
    to Jenkins after destroying the SSO session.
    
    <p>
    Note that disabling this feature while making authentication mandatory will immediately
    redirect the user to CAS login after logging out of Jenkins, which in turn will validate
    the SSO session and re-authenticate the user in Jenkins. This could cause confusion for
    users who may think they can't logout.
